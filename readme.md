# Web App Development Assignment - Thomas Grogan

I am a trained singer who performs regularly for various events so I decided to create a website for my music for this assignment.

## Requirements:

### Links

Links to pages within the website are present in the navigation bar which strectches across the top of each page.
Another internal link is used in the footer of each page. It allows the user to return to the top of the page they are viewing.
There are five links to external sites on the get in touch/contact page. They are social links which direct the user to my Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and LinkedIn pages.

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is at the top of each web page and includes five links to pages on the site.

### Table

There are two tables on the website. The first is on the bio.html page. It is used to list recent musical theater productions that I have performed in. 
The second table is on the contact.html page. It displays contact details such as email adress and telephone number. 

### Lists

The navigation bar is made using an unordered list. There is also a series of three unordered lists on the bio.html page which are used to list songs. 

### Video

There are four embedded Youtube videos displayed on the video.html page.

### CSS3 Elements

box-sizing - line 03, main.css; transform - line 281, main.css; flex - line 63, main.css; flex-wrap - line 59, main.css

### HTML5 Elements

article - line 21, bio.html; footer - line 29, index.html; main - line 26, index.html; nav - line 10, index.html

### CSS Positional Properties

The float property is used a number of times throughout the website. For example: line 100, main.css

### Inline and block elements

Block element: div - line 19, index.html
Inline element: em - line 26, index.html

### Responsive Design

I consulted a number of sources to learn more about making the size responsive to various screen sizes. 
I used the CSS 'flexbox' to create a responsive layout on a number of the site's pages. This involved creating rows with columns. The columns were each given a maximum width which would on smaller screen sizes. I got a lot of information about 'flexbox' from the following link: https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/

I also used media queries to increase the responsiveness of the website. These media queries can be seen from lines 291 - 346 in main.css. 
I got information about media queries and how to implement them from https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp.

Finally, I learned how to make social media icons increase in size when the user hovers over them. I learned this from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_zoom_hover.asp.
